## Why X Has Secret Features

It's a good idea to test a major feature before releasing it to the public. One of the ways the X team is doing this is by releasing changes to a small number of people first.

To determine who can see an upcoming feature, they use a mechanism called "feature flags". Only accounts that have a certain feature flag enabled, will see that feature.

Luckily, with this extension, we can get a full list of the available feature flags and enable them to try new functionality.

## How to Use Secret Features

When you open a new tab with X, you will see a new item in the menu:

When you click on it, a list of available feature flags will be shown.

Here you can filter by feature name and modify feature flags. If you want to reset all your changes, press the "Clear State" button in the bottom right. To exit without saving, just click outside the modal.

## Which Feature Flags to Try First

Because X constantly updates its code, the features in testing are also changing. Please follow [@512x512](https://twitter.com/512x512) or [@xDaily](https://twitter.com/xDaily) to learn about the latest features and how to activate them.
